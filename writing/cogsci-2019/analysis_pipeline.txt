Preprocessing
Step 1: Render sketches. On November 19th, we rendered all sketches from the kiddraw dataset (cdm_run_v4, and cdm_run_v3). This was done using the script located in:
brialorelle > kiddraw⁩ > analysis⁩ >  ⁨museumstation⁩ >  ⁨preprocessing⁩ > filtering_nov19 > 1_render_all_sketches.py

Step 2: Filter sketches. These sketches were then filtered using a combination of manual and automated procedures:
Image names were manually copied into different text files, all contained in:
brialorelle > kiddraw⁩ > analysis⁩ >  ⁨museumstation⁩ >  ⁨preprocessing⁩ > filtering_nov19 > images_to_exclude

Step 3: Recopy dataset and organize sketches.
Entire dataset was filtered and recopied using:
brialorelle > kiddraw⁩ > analysis⁩ >  ⁨museumstation⁩ >  ⁨preprocessing⁩ > filtering_nov19 > 2_preprocess_sketches.Rmd

Step 4: Feature extraction
VGG-19 features were extracted on fitlered dataset for all sketches using
brialorelle > kiddraw⁩ > analysis⁩ >  ⁨museumstation⁩ >  ⁨preprocessing⁩ > extract_features > extract_features.py

Step 5: Run classifications 
This wrapper script: 
	brialorelle > kiddraw⁩ > analysis⁩ >  ⁨museumstation⁩ >  ⁨preprocessing⁩ > run_classifications > spawn_multiprocess_jobs.py
Calls
	brialorelle > kiddraw⁩ > analysis⁩ >  ⁨museumstation⁩ >  ⁨preprocessing⁩ > run_classifications > run_classification_multiprocess.py

These outputs are in the enclosed folder, classification-outputs_C_0.1
These are compiled using count_classification_outputs.Rmd and saved in compiled_classifications

Pull tracing svg images from the database and write attributes to a csv file: https://github.com/Renata1995/shapedraw/blob/master/analysis/tracing/preprocess_museumstation-tracing_v3v4.ipynb

Apply the registration model on tracing images to get shape and spatial error: https://github.com/Renata1995/shapedraw/blob/master/analysis/tracing/shape_spatial_large.ipynb

Combine mturk ratings and model results into one csv file: https://github.com/Renata1995/shapedraw/blob/master/analysis/tracing/tracing_ratings_preprocessing-ordinal.ipynb

Fit an ordinal mixed-effects model on rated tracings and make predictions on new tracings: https://github.com/Renata1995/shapedraw/blob/master/analysis/tracing/ord_model_museumstation.Rmd
