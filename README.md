# Drawings as a window into developmental changes in object representations

How does the ability to draw different visual concepts develop? And what do children's drawings reveal about their knowledge
about the objects and categories in the world around them?

The repository is divided into four main sections:

## Experiments
Code for reproducing the experiments currently running to collect drawing and visual recognition behaviors from children:

### In use:
#### Museumstation: 
Currently running at San Jose Children's Discovery Museum (CDM)
#### Recoggames: 
Several versions of visual recognition games, also running at CDM, desinged to assess visual recognition behaviors
#### Bingstation: 
Currently running at a preschool to assess longitudinal changes in children's drawings
#### Ratings: 
Code to run experiments to get ratings from adults about the content of children's drawings

### Archive
#### Webstation: 
Code for collecting drawings from adults on online platforms 
#### Museumdraw: 
Initial drawing experiment run at CDM (supervised by an experimenter); data used in CogSci2018

## Analysis
Most anlaysis code is in development; sub-directories are organized with respect to the experiments detailed above.

## Writing
Text and code for reproducing the cogsci-2018 and cogsci-2019 submissions on the development of children's drawings.

## Data
A repository containing the large-scale database of children's drawings collected at CDM will be published with the preprint of the paper resulting from this project and is currently in development.
