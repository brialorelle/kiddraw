# What can children's drawings reveal about what they know?

How does the ability to draw different visual concepts develop? And what do children's drawings reveal about their knowledge
about the objects and categories in the world around them?

Below are brief descriptions of the main sections of the repository.

## Experiments
Code for reproducing the experiments to collect drawing and visual recognition behaviors from children <br/>

Museumstation: Ran at San Jose Children's Discovery Museum (CDM) <br/>
Recoggames: Several versions of visual recognition games, also running at CDM, desinged to assess visual recognition behaviors <br/>
Ratings: Experiments to get ratings from adults about the content of children's drawings <br/>
Webstation: Code for collecting drawings from adults on online platforms  <br/>
Museumdraw: Initial drawing experiment run at CDM (supervised by an experimenter); data used in CogSci2018 <br/>

## Analysis
Museumstation: Main analyses conducted on children's drawings collected at the children's discovery museum <br/>
Recoggames: Main analyses conducted on children's visual recognition behaviors at the children's discovery museum <br/>
cogsci-2018/cogci-2019: Main analyses associated with the two Cognitive Science Society proceedings from initial analyses <br/>

## Writing
Text and code for reproducing the cogsci-2018 and cogsci-2019 submissions on the development of children's drawings.

## Data
A repository containing the large-scale database of children's drawings collected at CDM will be published with the preprint of the paper resulting from this project and is currently in development.
