    In this survey, you'll be asked to judge how 300 different sketches were made.   Sometimes, we may draw something by constructing an outline of the entire object (see examples on left). Sometimes, we can make drawings by first drawing common shapes, like circles, and then putting them together (see examples on right). Your job is to rate the degree to which a sketch was made using by drawing outlines vs. putting simple shapes together.
