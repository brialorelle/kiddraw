    In this survey, your goal is to label the object depicted in 100 different sketches and photos. You’ll be shown each image one at a time, start typing a suggested label in a text box, and then choose a label from a word bank. Please keep in mind that there are only certain labels in the word bank, and take a moment familiarize yourself with the words in the word bank below. During the task, choices in the word bank that contain the same letters as what you are typing will appear so you do <b> not </b> need to memorize the word bank before you start.
    
    Guesses are encouraged, but if you cannot make any guess about the label of the depicted object you can also select "other/can't tell."
