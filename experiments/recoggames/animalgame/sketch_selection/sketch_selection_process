1. Grab stimestamped database (August 2018) when we had roughly equal numbers of sketches in 4 animal categories. Render
out all of the sketches (preprocess_museumstation.ipynb in museumstation > preprocessing)

2. Go through all sketches and eliminate sketches where children are off task (liberally speaking) -- get rid of
very very sparse drawings, drawings where dragged fingers, scribbles, drawing other items, etc. Note that more exclusions here can
actually only hurt the hypothesis that recognizability changes with age. These are tagged in macOS with a red
label, and then finder > search > label==red and you can copy-paste the filenames

3. Come back to python/R(?) script, read in all image names

4. Exclude all image names from list that are in the images_to_exclude list 

5. Randomly sample 30 images per category per age group (maximum given that 8-yrs often have few drawings)

6. Parse category, sessionId, age (3 combined are unique identifiers) of these selected drawings; output in csv file

7. Resave selected images in a different directory so that we can sanity check what we did

8. Upload selected images and .csv file to the animalgame experiment directory
