# Museum Draw

Inspired by the availability of this large and public dataset containing drawings of various visual concepts (Google quickdraw-75: https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset), this project asks how the ability to express these visual concepts in drawings develop?

It is a cool project and we will put more here soon.
