    In this survey, you’ll be asked to think about what different objects or animals look like, and make a list of attributes that are characteristic of them. Each attribute should consist of a short phrase (3 words or fewer). For example, for an elephant, you might say "big ears", "long trunk", "huge feet", etc. Please list as many attributes as you can think of, being as inclusive as you can: feel free to list attributes that may be shared by many other objects/animals, as well as those that are unique to a particular object/animal. Let’s begin!
